        <article class="wola-gray measure-wide f4 center lh-copy ph3">
            <p>To be a Border Patrol agent is to occupy one of the law enforcement positions most vulnerable to corruption anywhere in the United States. Mexican cartels, and other criminal organizations moving contraband across the U.S. border, enjoy stratospheric profits. They have deep pockets and seek to corrupt or blackmail security personnel on both sides of the line.</p>
            <p>Corruption grew as a concern during the 2004-2011 recruiting drive that doubled Border Patrol. Between 2006 and 2011, CBP agents at the border (of whom Border Patrol agents are a majority) faced 19,905 <a href="http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-13-59">allegations</a> of misconduct or corruption. 2,170 employees throughout CBP were arrested for misconduct or corruption between 2005 and 2012. While misconduct (drunk driving, domestic abuse, detainee abuse) is the largest category, a Center for Investigative Reporting report <a href="http://bordercorruption.apps.cironline.org/#all">documented</a> 153 serious corruption cases between 2005 and 2011. The <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/HSAC%20CBP%20IAP_Final%20Report_FINAL%20(accessible)_0.pdf">2016 report</a> of the CBP Integrity Advisory Panel, a Homeland Security Department commission headed by former New York Police Department Chief William Bratton and former Drug Enforcement Administrator Karen Tandy, noted:</p>
            <p>Over the past decade, the number of allegations of corruption involving CBP employees, both Border Patrol Agents and CBP Officers at the ports of entry, may be increasing as has the public perception, through the media, of increasingly pervasive corruption within CBP&rsquo;s ranks. Moreover, there is data indicating that arrests for corruption of CBP personnel far exceed, on a per capita basis, such arrests at other federal law enforcement agencies.</p>
            <p>Border Patrol&rsquo;s earlier hiring surge took place with less rigorous screening than today. The 2010 Anti-Border Corruption Act tightened background checks, including a rigorous polygraph exam. Agent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/20/us/politics/border-patrol-immigration-trump.html">Joel Luna</a> did not need to take a polygraph before he joined the force in 2009. In February, a Texas court sentenced Luna to 20 years in prison for working with Mexico&rsquo;s Gulf cartel.</p>
            <p>Luna&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2016/07/05/border-patrol-agent-charged-beheading/">story</a>, which involves a headless body being extracted from a Gulf of Mexico estuary, is grim and preventable. It is a warning of what could happen if hiring standards and integrity measures ease amid a hiring surge.</p>
            <p>Most Border Patrol agents are honorable, high-integrity individuals. Still, another rapid staffing increase could expand the risk of corruption for a few reasons:</p>
            <p><strong>a) The ratio of experienced supervisors to new recruits will shrink.</strong></p>
            <p>Already, about half the force has less than 10 years of experience. Onboarding 5,000 more agents within 5 years would mean that by 2023, 40 percent of the force would have less than 5 years of experience. (The estimate includes another 1,000 hires per year to keep up with normal attrition.) Any organization that grows this fast will face management challenges. For Border Patrol, these get compounded by transnational criminal organizations&rsquo; persistent below-the-radar efforts to subvert agents.</p>
            <p><strong>b) The urge to reduce hiring and screening standards will grow.</strong></p>
            <p>Unable to keep up with staff attrition, Border Patrol has been shrinking since 2012. Throughout CBP, the House Appropriations Committee <a href="https://appropriations.house.gov/uploadedfiles/23916.pdf">reports</a>, &ldquo;attrition has outpaced net hiring by 445 positions through the first eight months of fiscal year 2017.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>The main reason is the agency&rsquo;s hiring and screening process for would-be recruits. Recent reforms have reduced the <a href="http://defenseoversight.wola.org/clip/2802">average time</a> it takes to hire a new agent from a stunning 460 days to as little as 6 months to a year.</p>
            <p>The DHS Inspector General <a href="http://defenseoversight.wola.org/clip/3549">estimates</a> that Border Patrol would need to attract about 750,000 applicants to increase by 5,000. That&rsquo;s more than 1 percent of the <a href="https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2016/demo/popest/nation-detail.html">entire U.S. population</a> between 21 and 35 years of age.</p>
            <p>Beyond red tape in the hiring process, would-be recruits fail background and integrity checks at an eye-popping rate. In compliance with the 2010 Anti-Border Corruption Act, prospective CBP hires undergo the Law Enforcement Pre-Employment Test (LEPET) polygraph exam. About <a href="http://defenseoversight.wola.org/clip/3475">65 percent</a> of CBP applicants fail this exam. This is almost double the failure rate of other law enforcement agencies&rsquo; applicants (about 35 percent).</p>
            <p>CBP contends that the LEPET test is too time-consuming and &ldquo;adversarial.&rdquo; It is switching to a less intense polygraph, a modified version of the Test for Espionage and Sabotage designed for civilian analysts. Legislation advancing in <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/2213">both</a> <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/595/">houses</a> of Congress would waive the polygraph entirely if applicants are former military personnel who underwent similar testing earlier in their careers.</p>
            <p>WOLA, a human rights organization, claims no expertise on polygraph techniques. Law enforcement agencies, though, hold them in high regard. We note that former CBP Assistant Commissioner for Internal Affairs Jim Tomsheck (2006&ndash;2014), who developed the current LEPET test, has voiced <a href="http://www.npr.org/2017/02/22/516582946/white-house-orders-the-hiring-of-15-000-new-border-agents">very strong concerns</a> that a less rigorous exam could worsen corruption within Border Patrol. &ldquo;My professional opinion,&rdquo; Tomsheck <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/homeland-security/333698-why-is-congress-proposing-to-increase-customs-and">wrote</a> in May, &ldquo;is that if Congress allows CBP to reverse the progress made following the Anti-Border Corruption Act there will be many false negatives allowing dangerous applicants to pass the vetting process.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Before relaxing integrity standards, we need more information. Common sense would dictate that we first understand why CBP applicants fail the current test at such a high rate. CBP should also make public whether Border Patrol agents with military backgrounds are more or less represented on the list of agents sanctioned for misconduct, corruption, or human rights abuse.</p>
            <p>We note, too, that the 2016 CBP Integrity Advisory Panel went beyond endorsing rigorous polygraphs for new hires. It also recommended subjecting active-duty agents to random and targeted integrity checks.</p>
            <p><strong>c) With rhetoric about &ldquo;unshackling&rdquo; agents, the Trump administration is fostering a culture of resistance to scrutiny.</strong></p>
            <p>The National Border Patrol Council, the union representing most agents, made clear its displeasure with the Integrity Advisory Panel&rsquo;s recommendations. It <a href="http://www.bpunion.org/newsroom/press-releases/1786-statement-integrity-advisory-panel">rejected</a> the Panel&rsquo;s call to more than double the number of Internal Affairs investigators to 550 as &ldquo;throwing numbers at a problem.&rdquo; On the union&rsquo;s podcast, an agent <a href="https://www.spreaker.com/user/bpunion/episode-69-green-lives-matter">complained</a>, &ldquo;The entire report assumes that we are all corrupt and need to be treated as such.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Of course not all agents are corrupt. But the agency must still pursue good-faith efforts to root out the few who are, and the Panel judged that current efforts are &ldquo;woefully understaffed.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>The Trump administration&rsquo;s rhetoric is upholding resistance to accountability. The National Border Patrol Council endorsed Donald Trump during the Republican primary season. Its president served on Trump&rsquo;s transition team. &ldquo;The union supported this candidate for president, and now very much appears to be directing things &ndash; which is absolutely unheard of in law enforcement,&rdquo; Gil Kerlikowske, the CBP commissioner during the Obama administration&rsquo;s last two and a half years, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/border-patrol-chief-resigns-after-clashing-with-powerful-union/2017/01/26/23025c3e-e3f1-11e6-a547-5fb9411d332c_story.html?utm_term=.2d2a7bb91ac8">told</a> <em>The Washington Post.</em> President Trump <a href="https://www.spreaker.com/user/bpunion/episode-77-donald-j-trump">promised the union</a>, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re going to let them [Border Patrol] do their job the way they want to do it. That&rsquo;s going to be a big change, because right now they&rsquo;re being held back.&rdquo; Trump&rsquo;s Homeland Security Secretary, John Kelly, <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2017/04/18/home-and-away-dhs-and-threats-america?utm_source=hp_slideshow&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=dhs_hp">lashed out</a> in April against &ldquo;advocacy groups&rdquo; and other critics who have &ldquo;discouraged&rdquo; border-security personnel &ldquo;from doing their jobs for nearly a decade.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Such rhetoric fosters already-strong resistance to scrutiny. We see a stronger instinct to &ldquo;circle the wagons&rdquo; when credible allegations of abuse or corruption emerge. The Arizona-based Kino Border Initiative, a Jesuit migrant defense organization, has <a href="https://www.kinoborderinitiative.org/new-kbi-complaint-report/">carefully documented</a> frustrations in attempting to register abuse complaints with CBP. According to <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/05/05/asylum-seekers-turned-away/311552001/">several</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/us-border-officials-are-illegally-turning-away-asylum-seekers-critics-say/2017/01/16/f7f5c54a-c6d0-11e6-acda-59924caa2450_story.html?utm_term=.416731efed6c">reports</a>, CBP officers at ports of entry are illegally turning away more asylum-seekers. In a May <a href="https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/sites/default/files/hrf-crossing-the-line-report.pdf">report</a> on the phenomenon, Human Rights First found &ldquo;a marked shift in the conduct of some CBP officers towards asylum seekers since the election of President Trump.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>In a climate of resistance to scrutiny, violations like these&mdash;as well as incidents of corruption&mdash;could multiply. Add a massive hiring surge, and the agency could find itself in a full-blown institutional crisis. Such a crisis would play right into the hands of organized crime. This would undermine the majority of Border Patrol agents who are scrupulously honest.</p>
            <p>WOLA welcomes the proposed $45 million budget increase for CBP&rsquo;s Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR). This would increase OPR&rsquo;s 2018 budget to $205 million, or 1.8 percent of CBP&rsquo;s total budget. The burden of overseeing a massive hiring surge, though, would overwhelm any new capabilities that the increase gives OPR. As the Integrity Advisory Panel argued in unflinching terms, OPR lacks resources to hold accountable the force that exists today.</p>
